        <h1>Facts about Mercury</h1>
        <p>
            Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun
            At a distance of only about 1/3 of Earth’s distance to Sun, Mercury is the first planet in our Solar System.
            Mercury is also the smallest planet in the Solar System
            With a diameter of only 4880 kilometers (3032 miles) Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System. 
            It is barely bigger than our Moon. Not only is Mercury the smallest planet, it is also shrinking!
            In a very, very slow process, Mercury is getting smaller every day. 
            It is estimated that the planet is about 9 miles smaller than it was four billion years ago (we told you it was a slow process). 
            Astronomers believe this is happening because it’s iron core is cooling, which is making it solid, therefore reducing the planet’s volume.<br>
